Some of the lat and lon value are not the same length, this might be due to different resolution of the GPS gadgets. Specifically, an initial check can be done to investigate if the resolution is the same as normal, and also if there are same value existed but with different node id, a question mark shall be intrigued once these events happen.\n",
